# Take-Home-Assignment-1-CMPINF0401

This is an assignment for my Intermediate Programming Class at the University of Pittsburgh, which will lead into my final assignment. In it I am tasked with creating a desktop application using Java which will allow the user to sign up to volunteer at a food bank/pantry depending on their availability (day of the week/time/distance/need for transportation/etc.).
